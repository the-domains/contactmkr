  I live in San Francisco, CA., with my amazing husband and three equally
  amazing teenage children. Modern Kimono Robes and the four of them keep me
  very, very happy and very busy. I absolutely love Bikram yoga which keeps me
  sane, I love working in my garden in Sonoma, CA., and am passionate about
  vintage and finding treasures at flea markets. Sewing beautiful robes for
  everyone fits right up there with everything else that makes me happy. Thank
  you for taking the time to look at my shop and thank you for supporting
  handmade.
